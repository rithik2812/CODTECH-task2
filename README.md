## Overview of the project


## Project: Predictive modeling with classification

## Objective: The objective of this project is to buid predictive models using a dataset. 

## Major points: 

The data is split into training testing set. 

Various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and naive bayes classifier has been used here.

Accuracy, recall, pecision and F1 has been used to evaluate the models.


**logistic regression**:  Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict the probability of a certain event occurring. 
It's especially useful when the outcome is binary (e.g., yes/no, true/false, success/failure).

**support vector machine**: Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
The primary goal of SVM is to find the best boundary (also called a hyperplane) that separates different classes of data points with the maximum margin.

**Decision tree**: A decision tree is a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
It works by splitting data into branches based on different conditions, much like a flowchart. 
Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a final classification or decision.

**Naive Bayes classifier**:A Naive Bayes classifier is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. 
It is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

**Accuracy**:In machine learning, accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. 
It is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. In other words, accuracy measures how often the model makes the correct prediction.

**Precision**:In machine learning, precision is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. 
Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly identified positive instances) out of all positive predictions made by the model (both true positives and false positives).

**recall**:In machine learning, recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. 
Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly identified positive instances) out of all actual positive instances.

**F1**:In machine learning, the F1 score is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. 
It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. 
The F1 score is particularly useful when you need to find an optimal balance between precision and recall, especially in cases where the class distribution is imbalanced.
